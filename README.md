## The Problem

**SZABIST sends timetable emails DAILY** üìß, which creates a major headache for students:

- **Daily Email Overload**: Every single day, you get a new timetable email
- **Manual Searching**: Have to dig through your inbox daily to find your classes
- **Semester Filtering**: Need to manually filter out irrelevant semesters from the massive list
- **Time Waste**: Spending precious minutes every day just to see "What classes do I have today?"
- **Mobile Unfriendly**: University emails are poorly formatted and hard to read on phones

## The Solution

This scraper **automatically**:
1. **Connects to your Gmail** using secure OAuth (no password needed!)
2. **Finds SZABIST timetable emails** from your inbox
3. **Extracts YOUR semester's classes** using smart filtering
4. **Displays them in a clean table** - sorted by time, day, and course
5. **Supports multiple users** - your roommates can use it too!

### What You Get

## For Other Universities

**This scraper is built for SZABIST** but can be adapted for other universities that send timetable emails! 

### **To Use With Your University**:

1. **Check Email Format**: Your university must send timetable emails to Gmail
2. **Modify Email Parsing**: Update the parser in `backend/scraper/parser.py` to understand your university's email format
3. **Adjust Semester Logic**: Modify semester detection in `backend/scraper/semester_matcher.py`
4. **Test & Customize**: Run test scrapes and adjust the parsing logic as needed

### **What Needs Changing**:
- **Email Subject Patterns**: How your university titles timetable emails
- **HTML Structure**: How the timetable data is formatted in emails
- **Semester Names**: Your university's semester naming convention
- **Course Code Format**: How your university formats course codes
