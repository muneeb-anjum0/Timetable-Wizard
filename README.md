## The Problem

**SZABIST sends timetable emails DAILY** 📧, which creates a major headache for students:

- **Daily Email Overload**: Every single day, you get a new timetable email
- **Manual Searching**: Have to dig through your inbox daily to find your classes
- **Semester Filtering**: Need to manually filter out irrelevant semesters from the massive list
- **Time Waste**: Spending precious minutes every day just to see "What classes do I have today?"
- **Mobile Unfriendly**: University emails are poorly formatted and hard to read on phones

## The Solution

This scraper **automatically**:
1. **Connects to your Gmail** using secure OAuth (no password needed!)
2. **Finds SZABIST timetable emails** from your inbox
3. **Extracts YOUR semester's classes** using smart filtering
4. **Displays them in a clean table** - sorted by time, day, and course
5. **Supports multiple users** - your roommates can use it too!

### What You Get
- **One-click access** to your daily schedule
- **Clean, mobile-friendly** table view

## For Other Universities

**This scraper is built for SZABIST** but can be adapted for other universities that send timetable emails! 

### **To Use With Your University**:

1. **Check Email Format**: Your university must send timetable emails to Gmail
2. **Modify Email Parsing**: Update the parser in `backend/scraper/parser.py` to understand your university's email format
3. **Adjust Semester Logic**: Modify semester detection in `backend/scraper/semester_matcher.py`
4. **Test & Customize**: Run test scrapes and adjust the parsing logic as needed

### **What Needs Changing**:

## Setup Guide

### **What You Need**
- **Computer with Python & Node.js** (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- **Gmail account** (your SZABIST email should forward here)

- **Supabase account** (free tier works fine)

### **Time Required**: ~15-20 minutes for first-time setup

### **End Result**: 
A local web app running on your computer that automatically shows your SZABIST timetable in a clean format!

## Quick Start

### **Step 1: Download the Code**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/muneeb-anjum0/Timetable-Wizard.git
cd Timetable-Wizard
```

### **Step 2: Setup Python Backend**

#### **Install Python Dependencies**
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### **Get Google Gmail API Access**
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create new project (name it "SZABIST Scraper" or whatever you like)
3. Enable "Gmail API" 
4. Go to "Credentials" → "Create Credentials" → "OAuth 2.0 Client ID"
5. Choose "Desktop Application"
6. Download the JSON file and save it as `backend/credentials/client_secret.json`

#### **Setup Database (Supabase)**
1. Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com) and create free account
2. Create new project
3. Go to Settings → API and copy:
   - Project URL
   - Service Role Key (the `service_role` one, not `anon`)

#### **Create Environment File**
Create `backend/.env` file:
```env
# Your Supabase details
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here

# Keep these as-is
TZ=Asia/Karachi
PORT=5000
```

#### **Setup Database Tables**
The app will create tables automatically, but you can create them manually in Supabase if needed.

### **Step 3: Setup React Frontend**
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### **Step 4: Start Everything**
From the main project folder:
```bash
# This starts both backend and frontend automatically
run.bat
```

**OR start manually:**
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
python app.py

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
cd frontend
npm start
```

1. Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click "Sign in with Gmail" 
3. Allow access to your Gmail
4. Click "Refresh Data" to scrape your first timetable
